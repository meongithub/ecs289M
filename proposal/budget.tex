Table \ref{budget} lists all costs for this project. This team consists of three members, who will work on this project for two quarters. Therefore, most of the items are needed in the quantity of $3*2=6$ units. The salaries and benefits ensure that we will be able to follow our schedule and finish this project in time. Since one of our deliverables is a written report that will be published, the travel costs are necessary to present our work at a conference. For our research, we will need six CISCO IP phones of model 7800 costing \$120 each and a TP-Link 16-Port Gigabit Desktop/Rackmount Switch of \$60. The tuitions for all team members are necessary costs to make sure the team can focus on this project. Additionally, UC Davis requires an indirect costs rate of 56.5\%.
