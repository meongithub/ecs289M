The goals of this project are to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item evaluate possible threats to the privacy of phone calls by using a network sniffer to listen to unencrypted SIP packets.
\item analyze the risk of identity faking and social engineering by using CallID spoofing.
\item assess the security of the voice-over-IP network by performing man-in-the-middle and DoS attacks.
\end{enumerate}
