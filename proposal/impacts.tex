\section{Broader Impact}


Overall, regrettably, our project will likely not add anything to the state of the art in VoIP security. However, we intend to demonstrate shortcomings in the UC Davis campus-wide VoIP network and by extension in similar setups elsewhere. In addition, it is our goal to find solutions to these shortcomings where possible and to improve general security for the campus VoIP network. This will help ensure privacy of the calls made through the campus VoIP network.

In general, the weaknesses of the campus VoIP system and the strengthening of it through works such as ours, can be seen as a growing national trend to secure the nation's cyber infrastructure. As such, our research will help raise awareness of some common security pitfalls and security-aware best practices
