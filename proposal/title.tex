	This project will analyze threats to privacy and security of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) users at UC Davis. These threats are not specific to the campus, but are of interest for any large network operator and the security research community. The total budget for this project is \$80,506.07 and the deliverables include a final written report, a poster and a publication.
