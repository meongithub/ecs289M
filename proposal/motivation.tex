\section{Motivation}

Information and Educational Technology (IET) of UC Davis has started to roll-out voice-over-IP (VoIP) for the whole campus. Currently, there are 1,500 VoIP clients on the campus. By the end of this year, most clients should be upgraded from the traditional telephone network to VoIP. By enabling telephones to communicate over IP, one has to consider additional security risks. In order to evaluate the security and privacy concerns, IET would like this team to perform an analysis regarding these issues. This report will help IET to harden the VoIP network further and protect thousands of students and employees of UC Davis.

The VoIP network has to meet specific user requirements to increase the acceptance of this new system. Two significant properties are security and privacy. Users have to be able to trust the network that their conversations will be private. This is particularly important for institutes like Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), which offer service via phone and will deal with very sensitive details. 

Furthermore, our research will also apply to others. Since most networks use the same standard for VoIP, our possible findings will be important to other infrastructure providers. Hence, our project is of interest to the security research community as well.
