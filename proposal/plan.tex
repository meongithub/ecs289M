\section{Plan}

We will follow the steps listed below in that order to reach the goals enumerated in section \ref{sec:aim}. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We will build a test environment which is close to the real one and in which we can conduct our research with as few consequences for other users as possible.
\item We will install an ethernet packet sniffer to listen for SIP packets. We will record all these packets, pseudonymize them and build communication profiles from them which includes: Who speaks to who and how long is each conversation. We hope to build a social graph from this data.
\item We will modify SIP packets to hide our identity (CallID spoofing).
\item We will impersonate a PBX (man-in-the-middle) to redirect calls and listen on fully encrypted conversations by performing a timing attack.
\end{enumerate}

Further steps and directions of this research project will be decided on the basis of the results of above experiments and in close reconciliation with the technical director.
