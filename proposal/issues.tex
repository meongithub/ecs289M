\section{Issues}


We face three issues chiefly: a shorter than desired time window to finish the project, potential team attrition over the next quarter and, on the technical side, how to provide security when dealing with non-secure or legacy telephony networks.

The best solution for our team would be to prioritize gaining MITM access and to build a logical network topology from the intercepted traffic.
