The goal of the project is to explore possible security flaws with the UC Davis Voice-over-IP (VoIP) implementation. The Information and Educational Technology (IET) department at UC Davis will oversee and provide technical support for this project. Currently, there are about 1500 VoIP clients on the campus and the security risks assocated with them is unknown. The VLAN is susceptible to potentially any kind of attack through access points spread throughout the campus. The project will specifically evaluate possible threats to privacy, analyze risks of identity faking, and assess the security of the VOIP network through commonly known attack techniques.
