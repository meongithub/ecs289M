Problem statement

Information and Educational Technology (IET) of UC Davis has started to roll-out voice-over-IP (VoIP) for the whole campus. By enabling telephones to communicate over IP, one has to consider additional security risks. In order to evaluate the security and privacy concerns, this project performs an analysis regarding these issues. We identified three key properties for operating the VoIP network on the UC Davis campus:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Availability
\item Integrity
\item Confidentiality
\end{enumerate}

Our project focuses on integrity and confidentiality of the VoIP network. We divided our research work into three parts: (I) Evaluate possible threats to the privacy of phone calls by using a network sniffer, (II) Analyze the risk of identity faking and social engineering and (III) Assess the security of the voice-over-IP network by performing man-in-the-middle attacks. During our work so far, we found out that initial assumptions about the network were false, which required us to adapt our plan. More details regarding this issue are given below.
